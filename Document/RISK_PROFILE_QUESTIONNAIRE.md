## Complete Questionnaire

### **Question 1: Age Group**

**Question Code:** `AGE_RANGE`
**Question Type:** Single Select
**Weight:** 1.0
**Is Required:** Yes

**Question Text:**
What is your current age?

**Description (All Users):**
Your age helps us understand your investment time horizon. Younger investors typically have more time to recover from market downturns.

**RM Notes:**
Age is a strong indicator of risk capacity. Younger clients (under 40) can generally accept higher volatility.

**Client Notes:**
Your age affects how long you can invest and how much market fluctuation you can withstand.

**Options:**

| Option | Points | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Under 25 | 4 | Longest time horizon, highest capacity for equity exposure |
| 25-35 | 3 | Long time horizon, can handle volatility |
| 36-50 | 2 | Moderate time horizon, balanced approach |
| 51-65 | 1 | Shorter horizon, focus on preservation begins |
| Over 65 | 0 | Capital preservation priority, limited recovery time |

### **Question 2: Investment Time Horizon**

**Question Code:** `TIME_HORIZON`
**Question Type:** Single Select
**Weight:** 1.5 (HIGHEST WEIGHTED - MOST CRITICAL FACTOR)
**Is Required:** Yes

**Question Text:**
When do you expect to need a significant portion (more than 1/3) of this investment?

**Description (All Users):**
Your investment time horizon is how long you plan to invest before needing the money. Longer horizons allow for more growth-focused strategies.

**RM Notes:**
This is THE most critical factor. Time horizon determines asset allocation more than any other single factor. <5 years = conservative mandatory.

**Client Notes:**
If you need the money soon, we'll focus on stability. If it's far in the future, we can aim for higher growth.

**Options:**

| Option | Points | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Less than 3 years | 0 | Too short for equity risk, bonds/cash only |
| 3-5 years | 1 | Limited equity exposure acceptable (20-30%) |
| 6-10 years | 2 | Moderate equity allocation (40-60%) |
| 11-15 years | 3 | High equity allocation possible (60-80%) |
| More than 15 years | 4 | Full equity exposure acceptable if suitable |

### **Question 3: Primary Investment Objective** (MULTI-SELECT)

**Question Code:** `INVESTMENT_OBJECTIVE`
**Question Type:** Multi-Select
**Weight:** 1.0
**Max Cap:** 8
**Is Required:** Yes (Select at least one)

**Question Text:**
What are your primary investment objectives? (Select all that apply)

**Description (All Users):**
Your investment objectives guide the strategy we recommend. Different goals require different approaches.

**RM Notes:**
If client selects preservation + speculation, probe deeper. These are contradictory. Focus on priority ranking.

**Client Notes:**
You can have multiple goals, but we'll need to prioritize them when creating your strategy.

**Options:**

| Option | Points | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Capital preservation (protect what I have) | 1 | Conservative objective, low equity |
| Generate regular income | 2 | Income focus, moderate debt allocation |
| Long-term capital growth | 3 | Growth focus, higher equity allocation |
| Wealth accumulation for retirement | 3 | Long-term growth, age-appropriate allocation |
| Save for a major purchase (home, education) | 2 | Goal-based, time-dependent allocation |
| Speculation / maximize returns | 4 | High risk tolerance indicator |

**Scoring Method:** SUM (with max cap of 8)

### **Question 4: Emergency Fund Status**

**Question Code:** `EMERGENCY_FUND`
**Question Type:** Single Select
**Weight:** 1.5 (CRITICAL FOR RISK CAPACITY)
**Is Required:** Yes

**Question Text:**
Do you have an emergency fund covering at least 6 months of living expenses saved separately from this investment?

**Description (All Users):**
An emergency fund protects your investments. Without one, you might need to sell investments at the wrong time during emergencies.

**RM Notes:**
CRITICAL: If no emergency fund exists, recommend establishing one before investing. This affects risk capacity significantly.

**Client Notes:**
Having emergency savings means you won't need to touch your investments in a crisis, allowing them to grow long-term.

**Options:**

| Option | Points | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| No emergency fund, this investment might be needed for emergencies | 0 | Cannot afford risk, need liquidity |
| Less than 3 months of expenses | 1 | Limited safety net |
| 3-6 months of expenses | 2 | Adequate safety net |
| 6-12 months of expenses | 3 | Strong safety net |
| More than 12 months of expenses saved | 4 | Excellent capacity for risk |

How many years of investment experience do you have?

**Description (All Users):**
Experience with investing helps you understand market cycles and stay calm during volatility.

**RM Notes:**
Inexperienced investors tend to panic-sell during downturns. Factor this into behavioral coaching needed.

**Client Notes:**
Experience helps you make rational decisions during market ups and downs.

**Options:**

|--------|--------|
| None, I am a first-time investor | 0 |

**Question Type:** Single Select
**Weight:** 2.0 (HIGH WEIGHT - KEY RISK METRIC)
**Is Required:** Yes

**Question Text:**
What is the maximum percentage decline in your portfolio value you could tolerate in a single year before you would reconsider your investment strategy?

**Description (All Users):**
During the 2008 financial crisis, some portfolios fell 40-50%. Knowing your comfort level helps us prepare the right strategy.

**RM Notes:**
Historical context: 2008 crisis = 50% drop, 2020 COVID = 35% drop, 2022 = 20% drop. Use these as reference points.

**Client Notes:**
Think about your reaction if you saw your investment drop by this amount. Would you panic sell or stay invested?

**Options:**

| Option | Points | Allocation Implied |
|--------|--------|--------------------|
| Any loss makes me very anxious, I would reconsider immediately | 0 | 10% equity max |

### **Question 7: Market Downturn Response**

**Question Code:** `DOWNTURN_BEHAVIOR`
**Question Type:** Single Select
**Weight:** 2.0 (HIGH WEIGHT - BEST BEHAVIORAL PREDICTOR)
**Is Required:** Yes

**Question Text:**
The market has just experienced a sudden 25% decline. Your portfolio is down ₹2,50,000 on an initial investment of ₹10,00,000. What would you do?

**Description (All Users):**
This tests your likely real-world reaction to a major market drop. Historical context: This happened in March 2020 during COVID-19.

**RM Notes:**
CRITICAL: This predicts actual behavior better than theoretical questions. Use client's answer to calibrate risk capacity vs tolerance gap.

**Client Notes:**
Be honest about your gut reaction. Many people say they can handle drops but panic when it actually happens.

**Options:**

| Option | Points | Behavioral Type |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Sell everything immediately to prevent further losses | 0 | Loss averse, needs conservative portfolio |

**Is Required:** Yes

**Question Text:**
If your portfolio experienced a significant decline, how long are you willing to wait for it to recover to its original value?

**Description (All Users):**
Recovery from major declines can take years. Your patience determines whether aggressive strategies are suitable.

**RM Notes:**
Historical recovery periods: 2008 crisis = 5 years, 2000 dot-com = 7 years, 2020 COVID = 6 months. Set realistic expectations.

**Client Notes:**
Major market drops can take 3-7 years to fully recover. If you need the money sooner, we'll reduce risk.

**Options:**

## Scoring Calculation

```
For each question:
  points_earned = selected_option.points

For single-select:
  question_score = points_earned × question.weight

For multi-select (Question 3 only):
  sum_points = SUM(all_selected_options.points)
  capped_points = MIN(sum_points, question.max_cap)  // Cap at 8
  question_score = capped_points × question.weight

Total Risk Score = SUM(all_question_scores)

Calculation Breakdown:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Q1 (Age):                0-4 pts × 1.0  =  0-4

- Gate question for high-risk portfolios

**4. Emergency Fund (Q4) - Weight 1.5**
- MiFID II requirement (financial capacity)
- Determines true risk capacity vs stated tolerance
- Gate question: No emergency fund = Conservative max

**5. Recovery Time (Q8) - Weight 2.0**
- Validates time horizon consistency
- Tests patience (behavioral finance)
- Prevents mismatch between horizon and tolerance

**6. Age (Q1) - Weight 1.0**
